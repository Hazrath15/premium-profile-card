Display beautiful and customizable premium profile cards for your users using a simple shortcode.

== Description ==

Premium Profile Card is a lightweight and flexible plugin that allows you to display user profile information in a stylish card format anywhere on your WordPress site using a shortcode.

Features include:

* Easy-to-use shortcode `[profile_card]`
* Autoloaded helper functions and organized code using Composer
* Responsive design with customizable layout
* Clean and extendable codebase following PSR-4 autoloading standard
* Developer-friendly structure for building on top

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/premium-profile-card` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Run `composer install` inside the plugin folder (for autoloading support).
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
4. Use the shortcode `[profile_card]` anywhere you want to display the logged-in user's profile card.
